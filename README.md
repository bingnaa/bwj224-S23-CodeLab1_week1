# Wk 1 Homework for GameLab I

Gravity game with ball! Spins and hits randomly spawned objects- "good" or "bad".
"Bad" objects are in red. Three hits and you're out.
"Good" objects are in green. Each one you hit gets added to your score.

Issues to troubleshoot: multiple collisions being detected with same collider (add delay?)
Features to implement: Allow mouse to change rotation of the camera
